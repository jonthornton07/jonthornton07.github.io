    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p align="left">
      Hi there! For those of you who don't know me my name is Jon Thornton.
      I am currently a mobile developer for Cox Media Group. I have been doing native mobile development for about 5 years now.
      That includes Android and iOS, but my focus the last year or so has been in iOS.
      I enjoy doing both Android and iOS development and try to keep up with both.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
      You may be wondering if I do hybrid with my development. I tend to avoid any hybrid frameworks and cross compilers.
      While they have their place in the market I would prefer to focus on native (Swift, Objective-C and Java) development.
    </p>
    </br>
    <h2>Passions</h2>
    <p align="left">
      Obviously I am passionate about mobile development and creating the best experience for users with the understanding that there is a give and take between user experience and business rules.
      Sometimes they conflict but at the end of the day the goal for every side (UX, Business and Development) is to create the best product.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
      Some of my other interests include server side development and architecture.
      I understand that mobile is more of a frontend development paradigm and that server side development (the brains that power front-ends) has an entire different set up problems.
      I find that knowing as much about backend development can only help me in my passion of architecture.
      Someday I would love to get into a role of an Architect.
      Someone who can see the how all the systems of an entire company work and play together I feel like is very important in the technical world.
